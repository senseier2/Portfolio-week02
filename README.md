# Portfolio-week02
Portfolio Website

Building a responsive portfolio website for the client that displays their biographical information, Some images that link to a few of their projects, contact information, and their resume.

The menu has some hover elements so that the colors transition a bit to highlight user input.

Here is a screenshot of the overall page look and feel

Because the project involved adding links to projects we have not created.  I used placeholder images for future projects.
And the links currently point to my GitHub account and some social media pages.

Some of the social media links were also used in footer as well.

Other attribute of note in the final release were: 

    *simple color transitions
    *basic alternative photo float
    *feature cards as seen in the second half of the portfolio section
    *Text customizations using classed spans
    *Some hover interaction

In the future I would like to do a complete redesign to put a bit more focus on the look and feel of the overall site.
