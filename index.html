                <p>Hi everyone! I am a User Support Specialist, Sr. from Northwestern University's Office of Global Marketing and Communications.  I have been doing Desktop and User Support for approximately 15+ year.
                 I have some experience in Website design in terms of front-end graphics as well. Thank you for visiting my website, I hope to add more to it over the coming months.
                </p>

                <p>Unfortunately we have not built any applications at this point in the process but to fill out the space a bit I thought I would link youto something using
                    this example of the photo float.  There are a few responsive design bugs that I'm trying to work out so I really hope that I can fix them soon.
